### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am RaphaÃ«l Leroux, a ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª software developer.

I started in embedded, but have since pivoted to backend and infrastructure.

I've worked with C, C#, .NET core, Docker, MySQL, Redis and more.

Here is my [resume](https://indriapollo.github.io/rleroux-cv.html) and my short [bio](https://github.com/indriApollo/indriApollo/blob/main/BIO.md) if you're interested ğŸ˜„.
